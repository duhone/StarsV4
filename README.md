StarsV4
=======
written ~2001-2003 Visual studio 6. uses DirectX 9. 

Latest version of my starfield screensaver. Originally written in 2001 or so with
Directx 8 support. Later updated around 2003 for Directx 9. Upgrades over V3 included
3d rendered planets and stars. Uses shader model 2 in high quality mode with parallax
bump mapping and other shader effects. Not sure if all the code is here. The included engine 
could be the wrong one as well.
